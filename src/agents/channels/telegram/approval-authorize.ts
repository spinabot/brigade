/**
 * Telegram inline-approval authorization.
 *
 * When an approval prompt is rendered as inline buttons, ANY member who can see
 * the message could press a button. Brigade's central inbound pipeline already
 * runs the access-control gate before a `callback_query` reaches the
 * approval-callback path, so only an admitted (allow-listed / owner) peer gets
 * here at all — but a SHARED group is the edge case: in a group the bot is in,
 * an admitted member's button press should still be allowed only when that
 * presser is an approved approver, not merely present in the room.
 *
 * This predicate is the channel's `approvalCapability.authorizeApprover`. It is
 * invoked CENTRALLY by `tryConsumeChannelApprovalCallback` with the presser's
 * `senderId`; returning `{ authorized: false, reason }` refuses the press
 * without consuming the operator's pending approval (so the real operator can
 * still answer). Policy:
 *
 *   - When the channel has an explicit allow-from list configured (the approved
 *     senders), only those ids may approve.
 *   - When NO allow-from list is configured, defer to the access gate that
 *     already admitted the inbound and authorize the press (matches the text-
 *     reply path, which has no extra approver gate).
 *
 * Pure + deterministic over its `cfg` + `senderId` inputs — no I/O.
